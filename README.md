### Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
Within the evergrowing sphere of sport, people are looking for new tools to gain a competitive edge. The recent advancement of nutrition has allowed many of the top athletes to stay in their prime well into their thirties. Historically, this would be the rare exception, not the rule. Lebron James, Steph Curry, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi are all examples of the positive effects nutrition, combined with many other advancements, has had on the longevity of their careers. Whilst many sports have started to implement data tools to drive their decision making, I believe there is a massive opportunity for growth in this domain, especially in European Football.

North American sports teams have made greater strides in utilizing the capabilities of data driven tools. The movie 'Moneyball', a biographical film released in 2011, tells a story of a baseball team - the Oakland Athletics - using a sabermetrics approach to build an undervalued but talented team. Given the team's measly budget, the team overperformed greatly and went on a unprecedented 20 game winning spree, but ended up losing in the latter stage of the world series. This movie perfectly encapsulates the power of data in a historically dataless sporting world, that data driven insights can be truly a game changer. Ultimately, I am convinced that within the realm of European Football, the potential of data remains significantly untapped.

My project is centered on valuing football players. Over the last two decades, transfer fees have soared dramatically: from the world record transfer fee of €46.00m for Rio Ferdinand in 2003 to €222.00m for Neymar in 2017, marking a 482% increase in just 14 years! This surge has often left the public confused, questioning the rationale behind these skyhigh figures fee, as many football player fees can be worth more than their whole neighborhoods house value. 

My aim is to develop a model that uses the players season statistics to predict their market valuation. Traditional models have primarily relied on using basic metrics such as goals scored, matches played, age to determine market value, which I find too basic for an accurate assessment. My approach involves diving into more intricate metrics, including market trends, specific performance metrics, and contextual analysis. This deeper exploration intends to provide a fuller picture of a player's value, surpassing the accuracy of current conventional models.

This model will benefit multiple stakeholders within football. It offers clubs a reliable method to aseess player value, aiding in the valuation of potential signings and providing insights into the worth of their existing players. By offering enhanced information, this model equips clubs with valuable data that can inform their decision making processes.
