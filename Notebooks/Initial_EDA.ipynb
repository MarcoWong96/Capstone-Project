    "The first two datasets contains information about each individual player in the top 5 leagues in each respective season: the first dataset for the season 2022 to 2023 and the second dataset for the season 2021 to 2022. This dataset contains specific characteristics, including player nationality, age, team, competition, and also in game statistics like passes made per 90, shots per game, matches played in the season. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third and fourth datasets will provide valuation of individual players for each season. It is important to consider the timeframe. Ideally, I would like the valuations, for the 2022 to 2023 season, to be at the end of that season. This valuation date should be in the summer of 2023. Likewise, the valuation date for the 2021 to 2022 season should be in the summer of 2022.\n",

    "These two datasets are scraped from Transfermarkt, a third party company, and the valuation is based on their own internal modelling system. This will used as the training data for my model. These two datasets are from a different dataset than the first two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the fifth dataset will include all completed transfers and their respective transfer fees within the last 2 years. This will be used as our test data to check for model accuracy. Ultimately, this is our target: to be able to predict the transfer fees for football players.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to effectively model the players valuation, each dataset will be properly cleaned, and then appended together when required."

    "Although this heatmap is quite complex considering the number of variables, it actually tells a lot of interesting points. As the player statistics are generally organized in similiar groups, i.e. touches is before touches in final third, which is before touches in defensive third, most of the points close to the diagonal line is likely to be highly correlated. \n",

    "However, we can observe many blue patches in the heatmap, alluding to a negative correlation. Whilst some of the variables may directly be negatively correlated with each other by design, many of the blue patches do not seem related. This may come from different positions requiring different skills, almost specialist like. This may mean being superior in one skillset can lead to a deteriment of another skill set."

    "Most of the player's value is within 5 million Euros, with the mean at around 403,000 Euros and the median at 800,000, and the max at 180 million. This shows that the distribution is very highly skewed to the right. However, as noted above, this is further exaggerated by the presence  of market values of players outside the top 5 leagues."
